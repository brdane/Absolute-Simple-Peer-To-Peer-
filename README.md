# Absolute Simple Peer To Peer (ASPTP) v1.0.0
C++ Library by: Brenden Dane


Absolute Simple Peer-To-Peer (ASPTP) library is an incredibly simple library for C++ programming, to exchange data between computers, 
with no main-server or middleman required, via peer-to-peer connection. The method used with this library is through UDP hole-punching,
which basically temporarily makes an exception in your network's firewall and opens a specified port and socket, in-order to communicate
directly to another system.

I wrote this library as a frustrated programmer who couldn't find any already made, super bare-bones simple library for P2P connections
and communication. So, I made one myself and kept it as SUPER simple as I could. I've commented everything I possibly could and explained
everything in the simplest form to where a beginner programmer can understand.
